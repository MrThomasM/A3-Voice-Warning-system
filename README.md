# Installation
If your code already containts files from this repository simply copy paste the content of the code into your own code. 
for example: initPlayerLocal is commonly used so if you have this just copy the contents from mine to yours. 
The placement of the 'betty.sqf' and 'rita.sqf' is not very important as long as you define their location correctly in 'description.ext >> cfgFunctions'.

## Credits
It would be much appreciated to keep me as original author of the code.
